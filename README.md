# Timekeeper

Chrome extension to keep track of productivity


## Current State
- Keeps track of sessions using Date.now()

- Works with url updating, tab changing, window changing

- Alerts on initialize

- Alerts time of elapsed session in seconds on tab change

## Needs Implementation

- UI

- Persistent storage between chrome sessions (incognito as well)

- If two windows are open at the same time (multi-tasking), if you are  
  scrolling through the window that's not focused. The time isn't being
  counted for that window.
